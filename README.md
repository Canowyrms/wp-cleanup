# WP Cleanup

Cleans up various clutter, mostly in admin dashboard.

Much of this code is copied out of @vincentorback's [clean-wordpress-admin](https://github.com/vincentorback/clean-wordpress-admin), with slight modifications to suit my needs.

This is very much a work-in-progress - expect some best-practices to have been neglected.


## Installation

Install this as a standard plugin, or install it as an mu-plugin alongside [Roots' must-use plugin autoloader](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/mu-plugin-autoloader/).
